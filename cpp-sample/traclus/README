Hey there,

compile with make, you might need to adjust the Makefile, if you did not
copy the Github project completely. Point it to the trajcomp headers...

After unpacking, the following shows a typical usage:

make 

This generates the executable traclus.

This can be used as follows:

# Clustering prague with eps=25 and minLines=5
./traclus prague.XYI 25 5

The output goes directly into a CSV called clusternig.dat with columns

x1 y1 x2 y2 trajectory_index cluster
200 1552  243.88 1551.91  0 0
243.88 1551.91  251.96 1551.24  0 0
251.96 1551.24  263.27 1548.95  0 0
263.27 1548.95  271.04 1546.21  0 0
271.04 1546.21  281.28 1541.22  0 0
281.28 1541.22  299.78 1528.16  0 0
299.78 1528.16  311.98 1517  0 0
311.98 1517  326.69 1501.17  0 0
326.69 1501.17  361.61 1457.71  0 0

The first four columns give the segment (as segmented by the segmentation
functional). The fifth column tells us from which trajectory the segment
was extracted and the last column is the cluster ID.

True clusters are non-negative numbers,
Noise is -1 and rejected due to too few different trajectories (minLines 
is meant against numbers of trajectories not numbers of segments) 
are -2

For this example, we have actually two cluster, no noise and some
rejected segments.

Let us use R to show the result: Start an R session (R) and enter
>source("show.R")
The plot looks like the PDF in this directory
