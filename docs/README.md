# Welcome

Welcome to the initial joint release of the Trajectory Computing Library  **libtrajcomp** and the R module **trajcomp**. 
This project tries to collect various algorithms from the field
of trajectory computing in efficient implementations and make it accessible for everyone.

For some notes on the structure of this project and some involved design choices, check
out the [Design Page](/design)

If you can give useful comments or even contribute algorithms or patches,
send them to me via email or [GitHub](https://github.com/mwernerds/trajcomp).

Have fun and nice research results with our library and consider the following resources and articles:

* Send all your questions, ideas, and also stories of using this package to me,
* Spread a word about libtrajcomp and the associated R module trajcomp,
* Check out the source and cooperate via [GitHub](https://github.com/mwernerds/trajcomp).
